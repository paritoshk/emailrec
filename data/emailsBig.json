If you are in Finance, Strategy, or Operations, this will help you translate what the outside world values to your target operating model.\r\nThe “Next Buyer” Angle to Valuation\r\nLast week [ https://substack.com/redirect/de4cc826-555c-4a2a-a207-9633f52aaa93?j=eyJ1IjoiMThvNDE4In0.NISaA8T6ox_siOrBkiztHE1EMvrX0M2w6DvyJjK2MQc ] we talked about how venture fund returns typically follow a power law (e.g., 80% of the returns are generated by 20% of the investments).\r\nAs a rule of thumb, investors will often want to see a scenario where any given company could theoretically return the fund 1x.\r\nTo take that a step further… Investors are not only doing the math on what they have to believe you can do, but what the person who buys from them will need to think you can do.\r\nThis is called the Next Buyer sanity check.\r\nA growth stage investor explained to me:\r\n“You also have to think what the next person has to believe to buy it. \r\nSo if you believe it can go from $100M to $300M, you can’t stop there - you also have to believe that someone else will believe it can go from $300M to $600M so they can get their 3x return, too. \r\nOtherwise you don’t have an exit.”\r\nRemember - when a VC sizes you up, they’re not only doing the math on their way in and out - they’re also doing it for the next guy.\r\nMostly metrics is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.\r\nFigures for each index are measured at the Median\r\nAverage, Median, and Top 10 Median are measured across the entire data set, where n = 152\r\nAll margins are non-gaap\r\nSMB is defined as average customer size below $100K in annual revenue\r\nEnterprise is defined as average customer size above $100K in annual revenue\r\nYou can find the list of companies within each index here [ https://substack.com/redirect/0048fb07-8e8c-49bd-a912-69e194e5b8d2?j=eyJ1IjoiMThvNDE4In0.NISaA8T6ox_siOrBkiztHE1EMvrX0M2w6DvyJjK2MQc ]. \r\nAll definitions and formulas can be found here [ https://substack.com/redirect/7f0e0fea-8c3b-4390-b837-e9473d6a6a03?j=eyJ1IjoiMThvNDE4In0.NISaA8T6ox_siOrBkiztHE1EMvrX0M2w6DvyJjK2MQc ]. \r\nIf you’d like the specific company level performance benchmarks used in these reports visit Virtua Research [ https://substack.com/redirect/8f1289e8-ea9a-4be9-bdb4-efecb517f32a?j=eyJ1IjoiMThvNDE4In0.NISaA8T6ox_siOrBkiztHE1EMvrX0M2w6DvyJjK2MQc ]. \r\nRevenue Multiples\r\nRevenue multiples are a shortcut to compare valuations across the technology landscape, where companies may not yet be profitable. The most standard timeframe for revenue multiple comparison is on a “Next Twelve Months” (NTM Revenue) basis.\r\nNTM is a generous cut, as it gives a company “credit” for a full “rolling” future year. It also puts all companies on equal footing, regardless of their fiscal year end and quarterly seasonality.\r\nHowever, not all technology verticals or monetization strategies receive the same “credit” on their forward revenue, which operators should be aware of when they create comp sets for their own companies. That is why I break them out as separate “indexes”.\r\nReasons may include: \r\nRecurring mix of revenue \r\nStickiness of revenue\r\nAverage contract size\r\nCost of revenue delivery\r\nCriticality of solution\r\nTotal Addressable Market potential\r\nFrom a macro perspective, multiples trend higher in low interest environments, and vice versa.\r\nMultiples shown are calculated by taking the Enterprise Value / NTM revenue.\r\nEnterprise Value is calculated as: Market Capitalization + Total Debt - Cash\r\nMarket Cap fluctuates with share price day to day, while Total Debt and Cash are taken from the most recent quarterly financial statements available. That’s why we share this report each week - to keep up with changes in the stock market, and to update for quarterly earnings reports when they drop.\r\nHistorically, a 10x NTM Revenue multiple has been viewed as a “premium” valuation reserved for the best of the best companies.\r\nEfficiency Benchmarks\r\nCompanies who can do more with less tend to earn higher valuations.\r\nThree of the most common, and consistently publicly available, metrics to measure efficiency include:\r\nCAC Payback Period: How many months does it take to recoup the cost of acquiring a customer?\r\nCAC Ratio is calculated as: (∆TTM Sales * Gross Profit Margin) / TTM S&M\r\nCAC Payback Period is calculated as: (1 / CAC ratio) * 12\r\nNote: Some may measure CAC Payback using the change in last quarter’s revenue x 4, but I believe this overstates a company’s progress if they are growing fast, and the output can be volatile due to quarterly sales seasonality. That’s why I look at it on a Trailing Twelve Month Basis.\r\nRule of 40: How does a company balance topline growth with bottom line efficiency? It’s the sum of the company’s revenue growth rate and free cash flow margin. Netting the two should get you above 40 to pass the test.\r\nRule of 40 is calculated as: Total Revenue Growth YoY % + Non Gaap Operating Profit Margin %\r\nNon Gaap Free Cash Flow is calculated as: Net cash provided by operating activities, minus capital expenditures and minus capitalized software development costs.\r\nRevenue per Employee: On a per head basis, how much in sales does the company generate each year? The rule of thumb is public companies should be doing north of $450k per employee at scale. This is simple division. And I believe it cuts through all the noise - there’s nowhere to hide.\r\nRevenue per Employee is calculated as: (TTM Revenue / Total Current Employees)\r\nA few other notes on efficiency metrics: \r\nNet Dollar Retention is another great measure of efficiency, but many companies have stopped quoting it as an exact number, choosing instead to disclose if it’s above or below a threshold once a year. It’s also uncommon for marketplaces and fintechs to report it at all.\r\nMost public companies don’t report net new ARR, and not all revenue is “recurring”, so I’m using annual change in TTM revenue timeframes as a proxy in my calculations. I admit this is a “stricter” view, as it is measuring change in net revenue, rather than gross revenue additions pre-churn.\r\nA word from our sponsor Blue Rocket\r\nRevenue flat-lining? Has profitability taken on a new urgency since the capital markets have changed?\r\nSmall, skillful pricing changes make dramatic impacts on margins and revenue. \r\nThe journey to price optimization is complex, but you don't have to navigate it alone. Blue Rocket teams up with finance, product and sales to quickly improve profit outlooks.\r\nOur edge? BlueRocket's teams are all partner-level, seasoned professionals who have all operated businesses. We’re not just advisors; we're hands-on partners, ready to operationalize strategies with you.\r\nSeeking a pricing revolution?\r\nOperating Expenditures\r\nDecreasing your OPEX relative to revenue demonstrates Operating Leverage, and leaves more dollars to drop to the bottom line, as companies strive to achieve +25% profitability at scale. \r\nThe three most common buckets companies put their operating costs into are:\r\nSales & Marketing: Sales and Marketing employees, advertising, demand gen, events, conferences, tools\r\nResearch & Development: Product and Engineering employees, development expenses, tools\r\nGeneral & Administrative: Finance, HR, and IT employees… and everything else. Or as I like to call myself “Strategic Backoffice Overhead”\r\nAll of these are taken on a non Gaap basis and therefore exclude stock based comp, a non cash expense. SBC is still an important figure to track for total comp and dilution purposes, though. \r\nAll benchmarking data provided by Virtua Research [ https://substack.com/redirect/8f1289e8-ea9a-4be9-bdb4-efecb517f32a?j=eyJ1IjoiMThvNDE4In0.NISaA8T6ox_siOrBkiztHE1EMvrX0M2w6DvyJjK2MQc ]. \r\nFor assistance with your own benchmarking and equity research needs, contact cventi@virtuaresearch.com [ mailto:cventi@virtuaresearch.com ]. \r\nTell him CJ sent you; he'll hook you up!\"\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe https://substack.com/redirect/2/eyJlIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubW9zdGx5bWV0cmljcy5jb20vYWN0aW9uL2Rpc2FibGVfZW1haWw_dG9rZW49ZXlKMWMyVnlYMmxrSWpvM05UQXlPREEzTml3aWNHOXpkRjlwWkNJNk1UUXpNek0zTVRZekxDSnBZWFFpT2pFM01USTFNVFkxTVRFc0ltVjRjQ0k2TVRjeE5URXdPRFV4TVN3aWFYTnpJam9pY0hWaUxUSXpNRGMyTUNJc0luTjFZaUk2SW1ScGMyRmliR1ZmWlcxaGFXd2lmUS5PUFIzc1Z3blcyVlFnaFJLY2JNdDZqbWxTRzZ0UWRiQy1xT1N0U3hXQmNFJmV4cGlyZXM9MzY1ZCIsInAiOjE0MzMzNzE2MywicyI6MjMwNzYwLCJmIjp0cnVlLCJ1Ijo3NTAyODA3NiwiaWF0IjoxNzEyNTE2NTExLCJleHAiOjE3MTUxMDg1MTEsImlzcyI6InB1Yi0wIiwic3ViIjoibGluay1yZWRpcmVjdCJ9.Cw70TUYKJObpYL3ANVpumPImjmCr7PWyJrfCpP1y7e0?"

Both can be dealbreakers.\r\n\r\nSo — who’s right?\r\n\r\nLet’s break down both sides of the argument and find the truth.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n_Forwarded this email? __[Join 75,000 founders](https://go.houck.news/subscribe)__ and sign up now._\r\n\r\n\r\n----------View image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/093b6b3d-1a2a-474e-acf6-a281d4c73bc6/Group_168.png?t=1702334671)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\n----------\r\n## 🤝** A Message from **[**webAI**](https://www.webai.com/enterprise?utm_campaign=Early%20Access&utm_source=email&utm_medium=main-ad&utm_content=houcks-newsletter)\r\n\r\n[Meet Navigator](https://www.webai.com/enterprise?utm_campaign=Early%20Access&utm_source=email&utm_medium=main-ad&utm_content=houcks-newsletter) — the easiest way to securely build AI powered apps\r\n\r\nWith Navigator’s no-code or full-code canvas and training wizard, every person on your team has the power and flexibility to build and train computer vision models the way that best suits them.

Why Would You Not Want a Financial Model?**\r\n\r\nWhen you learn about entrepreneurship in school you’re taught to have a clear, strong business plan and financial model when you start out, and to use that as a way to communicate the path your business will take.\r\n\r\nThe real world is much messier.\r\n\r\nAny plan you had when you started (you know, that time before you actually learned how your ICP will respond to anything) gets changed quickly and many times.\r\n\r\nIn fact it changes so many times that you realize you could have learned what you now know faster if you hadn’t spent the time making the initial plan.\r\n\r\nIf you’re reading this newsletter you probably already know that.\r\n\r\nEvery day or even hour of your time that you devote to your startup needs to be spent getting it off the ground.\r\n\r\nThe same is true for a financial model.\r\n\r\nYour projections will be wildly wrong.\r\n\r\nNot only that, but the levers you have at your disposal in the model may not end up being what you think they’ll be — the entire business may change, and you likely don’t know enough yet at the pre-seed stage to be sure.\r\n\r\nInvestors all know this.\r\n\r\nThey see tons of startups and have many first-hand datapoints showing that everything can change and often does.\r\n\r\nWhat they don’t know is if YOU know that.\r\n\r\nInvestors are looking to de-risk the idea of investing in you. Startups are inherently so risky that they look for ways to think of your startup as less risky than others.\r\n\r\nOne of those ways is to assess your founder mindset — how much do you “get” what being a founder will really be like?\r\n\r\nThe thinking there is that the more you “get” it the more you’ll be able to anticipate challenges and emotionally steady when things get rocky.\r\n\r\nThis is a very common place where first-time founders and founders who don’t have a strong network in Silicon Valley fail to build trust with an investor.\r\n\r\nThat might not be fair, but it’s true.\r\n\r\nTwo of those signals for how well someone is ready to be a venture-backed founder are:\r\n\r\n1. How well they know how to prioritize their time\r\n\r\n2. Whether they realize everything will change from their “plan” or not\r\n\r\nPresenting investors with detailed financial projections at the pre-seed stage fails both of those tests.\r\n\r\n### **Ok… So Why is a Financial Model Useful Again?**\r\n\r\nIf all that is true then why does Jenny, a successful and well respected VC, want to see a financial model from pre-seed founders?\r\n\r\nIt’s not that she actually cares about your projections, or doesn’t value whether you have the “founder mentality” or not (she likely values that quite a bit too).\r\n\r\nShe and other VCs who want to see a model use it as a proxy for understanding whether a founder is able to correctly break down the incentives and value levers in a problem space.\r\n\r\nShe’s assessing a founder’s ability to do that precisely because, if the business needs to change, she wants to trust that this founder will be able to quickly figure out how to break down and evaluate new opportunities and position their product for success in a new market.\r\n\r\nThe same way you’d be able to more easily trust a civilized human than a wild beast, the thinking here is that a founder who can understand the levers in a business will make better decisions more often.\r\n\r\nIt’s just a different way of de-risking an investment opportunity and reaching conviction.\r\n\r\nInterestingly this mindset is more common in VCs based outside of Silicon Valley.\r\n\r\nTweet:  (https://twitter.com/ankurnagpal/status/1774926857508442276?s=20)\r\n\r\nI commonly hear from friends or [members](https://go.houck.news/upgrade) raising in Europe, Australia, and other places around the world that pre-seed investors want to see a full multi-year model and data room.\r\n\r\nWhereas in SF it’s more commonly about backing the right team that’s interested in the right market and assuming the rest will figure itself out along the way.\r\n\r\nI attribute this to a few things:\r\n\r\n1. Startup culture has penetrated the professional class in SF so deeply that the right founder will be able to learn from others and the collective knowledge of the network as they go much more easily.\r\n\r\n2. There’s a larger amount of capital available for VCs in SF, and more forgiveness by LPs if funds don’t perform as well as expected as long as the fund’s GP(s) are truly embedded in the SF ecosystem.\r\n\r\n3. There is a higher per capita density of great builders in SF, so investors can be pickier.\r\n\r\nI left SF a few years ago but this magical flywheel is truly special and can let investors focus on different indicators.\r\n\r\n### **The Truth**\r\n\r\nThe simple takeaway here is that each investor is different. Not only do they value different traits in founders, but they feel confident getting clarity on a deal in different ways.\r\n\r\nFor some, that’s a financial model, even if both they and the founder know that everything will likely change as the business matures.\r\n\r\nMy actionable advice for founders here:\r\n\r\nKnow your investor. Talk to founders they’ve backed before, and read their content online (you can use [X advanced search](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1400615906678542341) for this pretty easily) to get to know what helps them reach conviction quickly.\r\n\r\nAlso think about what type of investor _you_ want to work with. If an investor tells you they want you to spend time on a financial model for a pre-seed, do you take that as a red flag that they’ll make similar inconsequential (to you) asks in the future?\r\n\r\nDoes that matter in your decision about whether to let them onto your cap table?\r\n\r\nMaybe, maybe not.\r\n\r\nMy personal conclusion is that I’m better off trying to understand the information that gets me to conviction as a pre-seed investor in discussions with the founder and reference checks rather than from a financial model and, as a result, as a founder I’d want to partner with likeminded investors.\r\n\r\nBut for your startup it’s up to you.\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/093b6b3d-1a2a-474e-acf6-a281d4c73bc6/Group_168.png?t=1702334671)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\n## 💡** How I Can Help**\r\n\r\n----------\r\n[Become a member](https://go.houck.news/upgrade) to join the community, get access to all 90+ deep dives, our founder accountability challenge, and fireside chats with experts.\r\n\r\nI can also help your startup in a few other ways:\r\n\r\n\r\n----------### **Growth**\r\n\r\n[Grow your audience + generate leads](https://go.houck.news/megaphone) with my growth service.\r\n\r\n### **Fundraising**\r\n\r\n[Share your round](https://go.houck.news/fundraise) with hundreds of investors in my personal network.\r\n\r\n\r\n### **Hiring**\r\n\r\n[Hire curated candidates](https://go.houck.news/hiring) from top startups and communities.\r\n\r\n### **Advising**\r\n\r\n[I’ll help solve](https://go.houck.news/advising) a specific challenge you’re facing with your startup.\r\n\r\n\r\n🚀 Advertise in my newsletter to [get in front of 75,000+ founders](https://go.houck.news/partner).\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/093b6b3d-1a2a-474e-acf6-a281d4c73bc6/Group_168.png?t=1702334671)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\n----------\r\n## 💌** Share Houck’s Newsletter**\r\n\r\nRaising soon?

In most cases, though, it has been, \"new year, same VC market.\"<br> <br> Optimism is inherent to venture, and a single quarter won't change that, but Q1 did highlight some remaining chasms.<br> <br> I'll admit that I am in the camp that believes by the end of the year, 2024 will look like a better market than what we saw in 2023. Though, taking a realistic approach to expectations for the year is important.<br> <br> Global deal counts may look relatively strong, but <b><a href=\"https://url6380.news.pitchbook.com/uni/ls/click?upn=u001.d4n73BrX4Cuylw7SpSWIrf6GFa-2BaqM7ONnvsnswouzUIr5CyV7IWTNLxCH93ENcRW5EUXfqPQxKTWQi3i2Vqzg-3D-3DBieZ_mXWbCJTdrES8Bxix4B8DWsuZWsf2pJD1fUw-2FR9E86ywNTBaboietb4wB1t0OL3RYBDmbd3Co30nIfElpLrvOb3BE-2F5aU-2FV3vXAJz6-2BeOfOJPXx4TyKjJmt2oSIhwd-2Bu-2B0u4mCKp43WP276LkZ4isPAgIK0oikXQ1zlF241J02GBxh02jKPW2fsrhcalEftMeIbQ2w07rh8-2BBYuG0FL60rG8mUFpNl-2ByYHHfcJ9P8RFBde1nepsvOO1Zt1eDK1Xgybb6rkfoMhn6tMlaKPAQG-2BnNNs3rDI7fKZ5YlsXoKMe6d9jL0Mb6tBm-2B8o4T3bp1T1pVgqcoDg7rlVrbz4q-2BZM-2FzmO5ZW2ogzwKBaveihCIo-3D\" style=\"color: #1D5080; font-family: Whitney, Arial;\" test=\"\" universal=\"true\">deal value continued to trail off</a></b> and Q1 finished more than $100 billion lower than the peaks we saw a couple of years ago. This higher-but-lower dichotomy points to a continued high level of extension financings—smaller deals building runway for companies—and not necessarily a gauge for new money interest.<br> <br> Other concerning datapoints are easy to pick out. Fundraising and exits were, by most standards, poor.<br> <br> Global exit value was the lowest quarterly total since Q4 2016. Even in the US, where Reddit and Astera Labs' IPOs generated substantial buzz, total exit value was less than $20 billion.<br> <br> We are now two years into this venture correction, but there's reason to believe there is more that will be filtered out. Company counts are high, exits are low, distributions are minimal, and the market remains humbled.<br> <br> Silver linings are great, but masking the remaining market structure generates a false spring.<br> <br> Before our full venture reports come out over the next couple of weeks, we put together some high-level datasets as a preview that set the tone for expectations this year.<br> <br> Download the data here: <b><a href=\"https://url6380.news.pitchbook.com/uni/ls/click?upn=u001.d4n73BrX4Cuylw7SpSWIrf6GFa-2BaqM7ONnvsnswouzUIr5CyV7IWTNLxCH93ENcRW5EUXfqPQxKTWQi3i2Vqzg-3D-3DGtme_mXWbCJTdrES8Bxix4B8DWsuZWsf2pJD1fUw-2FR9E86ywNTBaboietb4wB1t0OL3RYBDmbd3Co30nIfElpLrvOb3BE-2F5aU-2FV3vXAJz6-2BeOfOJPXx4TyKjJmt2oSIhwd-2Bu-2B0u4mCKp43WP276LkZ4isPFxoQW77oOKyUBwih7V3iMcYhvkOIyr4-2BaNvuZFdyXB3Ei9kLbqBb53YM0ratWlN9Wy32pXUGYeMFAw-2BlRS-2BFASv3Ec-2BG-2FuNpg1I6TcDyGP8XbsohpZsddwHzbtZ1fK-2BzVJv7HaroTwDj7-2FHt8YbLHlOqV1TBLFkvUx-2FvkbUKQptlAWoQdBx-2B0WPtUhX1JnNF3IS3M8dS3QWERLdyq4RWP0-3D\" style=\"color: #1D5080;

As amusing as the image is, why would you? It’s futile. No matter how adept you are, you will be hindered by an environment that is built for one direction, and you’re trying to do another. It simply isn’t constructed for your goals. \r\nThis is true in every aspect of your life — the trick is spotting these misalignments.\r\nWhether it is the company you’re at, the position you hold, or the actions you take, it is crucial to periodically check in to make sure they are aligned with what you want to do and who you want to be.  Are your actions or environment keeping you stuck and stagnant, or are you spreading your wings and flexing in an environment that is allowing you to do exactly what you want to do and where you want to go.\r\nOnce you take the time to realign, you will always change your trajectory for the better.

That is a\r\nchallenge, especially in leadership positions.\r\n\r\nI know, I was one of them. I moved to England for my Master’s\r\nwhen I was 22, speaking average high school English. Today I\r\npodcast, speak in public and write books in English.\r\n\r\nEven if you don’t plan to host a podcast, being an effective\r\nleader or entrepreneur today requires us to speak excellent\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\nHere’s how you can get there in 7 steps. I know that some of\r\nthese (especially 1 and 7) run against received wisdom and aren’t\r\nnecessarily popular. But they worked for me and will work for\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n#1 Choose Your Accent\r\n\r\nDon’t mix British and American pronunciation. It sounds weird for\r\nnative speakers.\r\n\r\nDecide which English you are going to speak.\r\n\r\n#2 Lose Your Accent\r\n\r\nHone in on the 10% of sounds that give you a stereotypical\r\naccent.\r\n\r\nIf you want to imitate a German accent in English, you pronounce\r\nthe “th” as a “z”.\r\n\r\nThat’s why I had to practice my ”th” (plus my “w”, “v” and “r”).\r\nI did it by imitating lip, tongue and mouth movements in front of\r\na mirror.\r\n\r\n#3 Raise The Stakes\r\n\r\nIn “The Tim Ferriss Experiment” (on YouTube), Tim commits to\r\nlearn Tagalog in 4 days before giving a live TV interview in the\r\nFilipino language.\r\n\r\nI did the same when I moved to England to study. Bad English =\r\nbad grades & few friends.\r\n\r\nCommit to speak in public in 1 month to raise the stakes.\r\n\r\n#4 Immerse Yourself\r\n\r\nThe typical classroom model is broken. You don’t want to spend\r\nyears in a state of mediocrity.\r\n\r\nImmerse yourself with a coach, by spending time in a country, or\r\nby attending an intensive course to break through the language\r\nbarrier.\r\n\r\n(Read ‘Ultralearning’ by Scott H.Young on immersion.)\r\n\r\n#5 Love The Culture\r\n\r\nI lived in different countries, learning different languages.\r\n\r\nLearning the language when I loved the culture was fun. When I\r\ndidn’t, it was hard work.\r\n\r\nMy 14-year old loves Billie Eilish and has translated all her\r\nsongs into German.\r\n\r\nWhat do you love about the culture of the English-speaking world?\r\n\r\n#6 Know How You Learn\r\n\r\nNeuroplasticity is higher in children, yet adults like us have a\r\nbig advantage: we know how we learn best.\r\n\r\nIs it an app like Babbel, virtual live classes like Lingoda, or\r\nwriting down every new word on a cue card to enhance\r\nmemorization?\r\n\r\n#7 Aim For Perfection\r\n\r\nUnpopular advice, I know. But if you want to perfect your English\r\nto be an international business leader, aim for perfection.\r\n\r\nWhenever I come across a word I don’t know or don’t know how to\r\npronounce, I look it up.\r\n\r\nIs my English perfect? Of course not. But way better than my\r\n20-year old self would have ever imagined.\r\n\r\nMany people will tell you your English is good enough. I never\r\nlistened to them. And I still don’t. Instead, I enjoy the process\r\nof improving a little bit every day – and I hope you enjoy it\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\nEVENT\r\n\r\n***************************************\r\nLet’s Talk!

She also\r\nprovides insights into the extraordinary history of AI going back\r\nthousands of years, from ancient texts to Ada Lovelace's\r\npioneering work in the 1800s.\r\n\r\nLéa discusses both the huge potential for AI to increase\r\nproductivity and creativity, as well as the risks of content\r\noverload and struggling to distinguish what's important.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Léa shares her secrets to speaking in front of\r\nthousands – how she prepares, gauges what the audience needs and\r\nhow creates her trademark presence on stage.\r\n\r\nWhether you're hoping to leverage AI's benefits, are concerned\r\nabout its implications, or simply want to communicate more\r\neffectively, this episode will leave you much wiser about the\r\npast, present and future of AI.\r\n\r\nListen on Spotify and Apple:\r\n\r\n​ (\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/8kue5k2mdwtoh0nmnxwukhzp7n399/qvh8h7hrqr98qpal/aHR0cHM6Ly9vcGVuLnNwb3RpZnkuY29tL3Nob3cvNXFDMXdvdVhncWxFcTF5ZVFmOFE2MD9zaT05YTA0N2NjM2Y3MDc0YmZh\r\n) ​ (\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/8kue5k2mdwtoh0nmnxwukhzp7n399/3ohphkh7v7eqveir/aHR0cHM6Ly9wb2RjYXN0cy5hcHBsZS5jb20vZGUvcG9kY2FzdC9zcGVhay1saWtlLWEtY2VvL2lkMTQ0MTQxOTUzNQ==\r\n)\r\n\r\nBOOK RECOMMENDATIONS\r\n\r\n*********************\r\n8 Books on Persuasion\r\n*********************\r\n\r\n#1 Influence by Robert B.

In fact, the company, which has built an open-source platform for developers and engineers that hosts AI models and tools, has already raised nearly $400m to date from a host of high-profile US VCs like Sequoia Capital and Coatue.\r\n\r\nTech big hitters like Google, Amazon, Nvidia and Intel also joined its $235m Series C closed last year, at a reported $4.5bn valuation.\r\n\r\nBut until now, the company’s gone under the radar in its home country. “They are one of these companies that are better-known in the US than in France, even though the three founders are French and they have their offices in central Paris,” one open-source startup founder tells me.\r\n\r\nThis is changing as French tech takes a heightened interest in all things AI — driven largely by the blockbuster fundraising rounds completed by Paris-based Mistral, which in less than a year after launching has raised nearly €500m. AI startups are popping up at unprecedented speed in France (https://email.sifted.eu/e3t/Ctc/LZ+113/d2mfCN04/VXcl-N8YkN7pW92HLbQ6R3qL6W2bnPc75cwlwyN4MwsfM3prCCW7lCdLW6lZ3pZW44swZ06MpTKJW2Zd8_25WHc34W6D-Mzd71MmMWW2BMDlz2RKNBbW7W7DZh2BmnsbW99zt3V55pqxNW9gKHxj2t5-wBMD9h8f8kL-0W2Gbv845tBcQ-W7D00GH5vdGMSW3wv-dl5VrbwtW19nf845tRCDJN6t91wLJzCP_W1N4Q288hltKxW35BDK86PnNQNW5-2Grr8rrpqNW8q4v5t981G6fW6n2lkK4KBCKDN6XWh4wgZyVWW5MPR3W7_wTXmVsqqRg8ptHp6W7dp4NM9gQt1XW1MPFc736MGmLN4SX2QdCskj8d-Q1Rd04 ) — and Hugging Face is increasingly being seen as an early example of success in the sector for everyone else to look up to.\r\n\r\nSo what is its secret recipe? Though the founders consider the company to be Franco-American, and its biggest team is based in Paris, the answer lies in the US — as it often does for startups over here.\r\n\r\nFrom day one, Hugging Face has raised money with US investors, it’s signed partnerships with big US companies and now sees the majority of its revenue originating from the other side of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nAnd although things are moving fast in French tech, it’s a playbook that cofounder Julien Chaumond still recommends — especially when it comes to raising funds.\r\n\r\n“French and European VCs are still one step behind in terms of the risks they are taking,” he tells Sifted.\r\n\r\n“There is more money in Europe, but I’ve been completely blown away when talking with some of our investors in the US. It’s another level of game, and that’s still the case.”\r\n\r\nI sat down with Chaumond to discuss Hugging Face’s success in the US (https://email.sifted.eu/e3t/Ctc/LZ+113/d2mfCN04/VXcl-N8YkN7pW92HLbQ6R3qL6W2bnPc75cwlwyN4Mwsg23prCCW7Y8-PT6lZ3mJW5Z2Fr_2qBJtJW6ZpkQk1LGPDWW7MGFjD2fp22sVTRVTM5jjpw5W8MPFd14w0jKHW3mhZ2C6KZJr8W8WgbMY69p-zMW7QjS7X5dfCBrW4CMpZS1PWvhkW4Q1C_D3Rxy14W52YzrM3_XKxcN2kXpvzKq0BnW3kwB2Z60Q7qqN25NWBkk80FJN29b7LqMQ_YkW2XBwWN7HCVnSN2jV3CDByCGrW3tLjCS5tm8D0V_q6nd1ywrR0VRT8wH7Y8Y0LW7cFZy48K1FgrW8QNj7-1n8TGDW30pFpB8rn3C7VSy1867NtwlbW3bdCr68yS1KrW56QC4G8y-Kr6f4Rjf0R04 ) , how the company is already emerging as a founders factory — and how it all started with Alanis Morissette covers…\r\n\r\n— Daphné Leprince-Ringuet (https://email.sifted.eu/e3t/Ctc/LZ+113/d2mfCN04/VXcl-N8YkN7pW92HLbQ6R3qL6W2bnPc75cwlwyN4MwsfM3prCCW7lCdLW6lZ3lKVYNllf2dqxKXW55HJfv8dgbYzW7rmhRM1f3wp5W2WbBPz9dL0zXN1ThswRY24X9W4ZTJ0w3QR902N3L2kX_tMwxsW6TKGnt4bcdHBW4yzxDb3h9Tj3TBBcW72s_cRW5JS8gW71S3rSW3d85757r5Dq9W49gFkv5yzwQnN3XtTHB-mfmpN6z09bK_k9ZtW4S1cwf5QgD8pW73_Rq7761srZVK38j13PyC-BW6S8ZPp1wLBHkW8wvFTv3HGNN4W289NRH7w8qDjW6M1QnB6_HbQGW16RYY68hPGx1W1h2kgK4jFv16f4WxsXP04 ) , French tech reporter\r\n\r\n🇫🇷 French SaaS company Pigment, which provides enterprise customers with a platform that lets them visualise critical business data in real-time, ranging from profit and revenue to burn rate and headcount, has raised $145m in Series D funding (https://email.sifted.eu/e3t/Ctc/LZ+113/d2mfCN04/VXcl-N8YkN7pW92HLbQ6R3qL6W2bnPc75cwlwyN4MwsfM3prCCW7lCdLW6lZ3mGW53YR2t6vhbtvN2F02bzDG6PTW7X1qQD5k-KPmV8PvXJ4YzGlkW8lLGgg8PcTQMW6N9yjx2ctGMNW51fGnf3Cz6KVW6HmgCr6W-Pq5W97qqnC8T0gJYW843Xzt1KVzf-W6GsB1V87ZLvxVr7h0N63RklyW6L-gWZ2Nh_lpW1YYjPW3_KFGpW1hDC8P1zmdxDW1BDV378Gs_vtW2hf17M4_kV9tW85JWpy3vFqhQW5HprbJ7WHPp0W73bnT763QMpCW425SJb1tcHhSW6-JGtX1YVSVbVSPjDX4tPR1mW4ccc5M6kMYGCdp0L6W04 ) to support its growth in North America.\r\n\r\n- The equity round was led by US VC Iconiq Growth, with participation from US-based Sandberg Bernthal Venture Partners and returning investors IVP, Meritech, Greenoaks — also from the US — as well as UK VC Felix Capital.\r\n- The company remained coy on its latest valuation, but cofounder Eléonore Crespo says it “has significantly increased since last year”.\r\n\r\nSifted Reports (https://email.sifted.eu/e3t/Ctc/LZ+113/d2mfCN04/VXcl-N8YkN7pW92HLbQ6R3qL6W2bnPc75cwlwyN4Mwsg23prCCW7Y8-PT6lZ3kCN6ctPjsJ1BYyW8GwHj54Cn0G_VF_TBK4nbzQLVsyPwQ4NQ2ZSW5_m0_s7J_2LzW8B2vGT4jPq6mW4Hx4Tj7PNcsnW40pmRZ7JlZqnW2Wf70M2ct5XGV_V_ks7pr5LJW6wrj422hsZ-7W41p5wK5P2zvzN12cwDj1Bf5tW5rb-pH6Ls42yW7jKQm54jD2n-W84Pg6n2zFJWKW4bw9mF12DqsdW461ydd2wRcbZN7mH-4T8bfz-W2JVZ49741y_mW1FbNH78ckSjwN2cThDZMplWyW7sgjjf4_fkkfVD_Fhw5b-sW3W3rCvPD40S8CkW2LJB7Q6NbHYyf73CgNl04 )\r\n\r\nOur Sifted 100 highlights (https://email.sifted.eu/e3t/Ctc/LZ+113/d2mfCN04/VXcl-N8YkN7pW92HLbQ6R3qL6W2bnPc75cwlwyN4Mwsg23prCCW7Y8-PT6lZ3kCN6ctPjsJ1BYyW8GwHj54Cn0G_VF_TBK4nbzQLVsyPwQ4NQ2ZSW5_m0_s7J_2LzW8B2vGT4jPq6mW4Hx4Tj7PNcsnW40pmRZ7JlZqnW2Wf70M2ct5XGV_V_ks7pr5LJW6wrj422hsZ-7W41p5wK5P2zvzN12cwDj1Bf5tW5rb-pH6Ls42yW7jKQm54jD2n-W84Pg6n2zFJWKW4bw9mF12DqsdW461ydd2wRcbZN7mH-4T8bfz-W2JVZ49741y_mW1FbNH78ckSjwN2cThDZMplWyW7sgjjf4_fkkfVD_Fhw5b-sW3W3rCvPD40S8CkW2LJB7Q6NbHYyf73CgNl04 )\r\n\r\nDiscover the pulse of tech innovation in the UK and Ireland with our latest report.

            "body": "View this post on the web at https://beyondproductivity.substack.com/p/how-to-own-your-day-4-time-management\r\n\r\n\"What is important is seldom urgent, and what is urgent is seldom important.\"\r\n– Dwight D. Eisenhower\r\nWhat to do\r\nOwn your day with 4 time management methods.\r\nWhy it works\r\nU.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower (pictured above) rose to fame as a superb leader and strategist during World War II. As the Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force, he oversaw the planning and execution of Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of Normandy on June 6, 1944. Famously known as D-Day, this invasion marked a turning point in the war and led to the liberation of Western Europe from Nazi occupation.\r\nBesides his leadership, Eisenhower was also known for his exceptional ability to manage his time and priorities. During his presidency from 1953 to 1961, he faced many responsibilities, ranging from domestic issues to international affairs. Throughout his long career, he was deliberate about distinguishing between what’s truly important and merely urgent. He excelled at remaining focused on the most significant, important tasks while not succumbing to the pressures of the immediate, urgent ones.\r\nAs his example shows, the key to time management is balancing urgent and important work. If you want to own your day, you need to decide which tasks are urgent, which tasks are important, and when (not) to do specific tasks. Here are 4 time management methods to pull this off and own your day — plus a handy cheat sheet.\r\nHow to do it\r\nEisenhower Matrix. Created by Eisenhower himself (and popularized in Stephen Covey’s book “The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People”), this is arguably the best tool for determining what’s urgent, important, both or neither. After classifying all your tasks accordingly, start with those in the “Do” quadrant (see cheat sheet below). Then, move on to the “Schedule” quadrant. Only then work on the lower quadrants (the “Delegate” and “Eliminate” ones). Learn more about using the Eisenhower Matrix here [ https://substack.com/redirect/8309c453-8a7c-420b-9a03-35d61d7130ca?j=eyJ1IjoiMThvNDE4In0.NISaA8T6ox_siOrBkiztHE1EMvrX0M2w6DvyJjK2MQc ].\r\nEat the Frog. Popularized by Marc Twain, this is a great way to make progress on hard and important tasks (e.g. deep work). It’s dead simple: do your most important, hardest work first thing in the morning. If you’re among the 25% of people with a late chronotype (aka “night owls”), do it later in the day instead. If you want to learn more about determining your chronotype and timing deep work accordingly, check out this article [ https://substack.com/redirect/1046ede0-1efe-409c-ad19-69d4982b4c40?j=eyJ1IjoiMThvNDE4In0.NISaA8T6ox_siOrBkiztHE1EMvrX0M2w6DvyJjK2MQc ].\r\nPomodoro. Use Francesco Cirillo's popular method to complete hard and urgent tasks (e.g., email). Here’s how: Focus for 25 minutes and then take a 5-minute break. Repeat four times, then take a longer break. While Cirillo’s method is helpful for shorter tasks, it’s far from ideal for challenging deep work that requires extended focus. That’s why I use an altered version of that method — the Pomodoro 2.0. Learn more about the Pomodoro 2.0 here [ https://substack.com/redirect/11859fe2-8804-4e38-9f2d-498bb31acee2?j=eyJ1IjoiMThvNDE4In0.NISaA8T6ox_siOrBkiztHE1EMvrX0M2w6DvyJjK2MQc ].\r\nTimeboxing. Popularized by Nir Eyal in his book “Indistractable”, this is the best method I’m aware of to decide when (not) to do specific urgent or important tasks throughout your day. Here’s how to use it: Start by grouping similar tasks together and put them on your calendar (see cheat sheet below). As you go through your day, stick to the schedule whenever possible, and adapt it if necessary. If you want to delve deeper into timeboxing, read this article [ https://substack.com/redirect/8a64117c-52a6-4f0e-b89a-6c05cb5d8fc2?j=eyJ1IjoiMThvNDE4In0.NISaA8T6ox_siOrBkiztHE1EMvrX0M2w6DvyJjK2MQc ].\r\nTry these 4 time management methods to own your day – and follow me on LinkedIn  [ https://substack.com/redirect/69db21ad-e983-4427-86a4-5e5c3ae5d0ad?j=eyJ1IjoiMThvNDE4In0.NISaA8T6ox_siOrBkiztHE1EMvrX0M2w6DvyJjK2MQc ]for daily tips and more cheat sheets on habits, productivity and personal development \r\nLastly, please share this post with one person who might benefit from doing so, too.\r\nUntil next week,\r\nChristian\r\n2 more ways I can help you\r\n1) 1-on-1 Coaching Program\r\nDo you struggle with focusing on the important work while jumping from one urgent task to the next? Do you feel tired in the morning and throughout the day despite sleeping for 7 or 8 hours at night? Do you have trouble dealing with high stress at work and “switching it off” at home?\r\nIf so, my new Becoming Ultraproductive 1-on-1 coaching program might help. In it, I help executives, entrepreneurs and CEOs build rock-solid habit systems for deep focus, deep sleep, and mastering stress — to increase their productivity by between 100% and 900% while making stress work for them instead of against them.\r\nThe 1-on-1 coaching program includes six sessions over 12 weeks. If you’re interested, learn more about the program and get in touch below – or simply reply to this email.\r\n2) Executive Search\r\nI’m also a partner at Poensgen Digital, an executive search boutique my wife founded in 2021. We specialize in helping clients find executives for the most important positions in the digital age.\r\nAgainst this background, we focus on four areas: management consulting, corporate, venture capital, and private equity. From our past searches for leading European companies in each of these areas, we built an extensive network of 10,000+ high-potentials with 2-30 years of work experience.\r\nIf you’re interested in learning more, follow the link below to get in touch – or simply reply to this email.\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe https://substack.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.8A5ganZAn9_Kqjg_KXS_nVqdQV_SyEWfnMrSkYGywoE?"

Andrew Gazdecki is the founder of Acquire.com, an online marketplace for buying and selling startups. He’s also gone through the process of selling his own startups more than once, so he is actually the perfect person to answer the big question:\r\n\r\nHow are startups bought and sold?\r\n\r\nWell, one of the first myths that Gazdecki is quick to dispel is the idea (hope?) that buyers just materialize when you need them. Instead, getting acquired is much like getting funding or making sales – you need to find potential buyers and funnel them through your process in order to give yourself the best chance for success on the best terms.\r\n\r\nSo let’s say you’ve identified a few potential buyers and are getting that process started. What do the steps tend to look like?\r\n\r\nKick Off\r\n\r\nThe kick off call is usually a high-level, getting to know each other session – both personally and professionally. Personally, you want to show that you’re open to the ideas of others, easy to work with, and able to answer questions honestly, without getting defensive.\r\n\r\nOn the business side, you want them to know what your company does and some possibilities for where it could go.\r\n\r\nGazdecki is quick to note getting acquired requires a certain amount of goodwill between the parties.Things crop up along the way – requests for updated or brand new metrics, the VP of Strategic Partnerships getting replaced midway through the process, etc – this is where having a relationship of mutual respect helps you weather anything that may arise going forward.\r\n\r\nDocumentation, including a deal timeline.\r\n\r\nDocumentation in this case includes things like a Confidential Information Memorandum (CIM), your financial statements, and due diligence documents. This is where you get into the details of things like go-to-market strategy, customer acquisition and retention plans, company and growth data, and everything else that makes your business tick.\r\n\r\nCreating a timeline establishes when certain milestones will be hit – for example, when you’ll provide your financial documents or when the buyer will provide a letter of intent (LOI). Having this timeline keeps everyone involved accountable.\r\n\r\nEvaluate offers\r\n\r\nPart of the reason timelines are so helpful is because they funnel buyers into getting you what you really want – multiple offers. Multiple offers means you have leverage to negotiate. As you look at offers, evaluate them not just by the number of the purchase price, but also by the details of the purchase. Look at cash vs. stock, what earn-out periods look like, if there are any conditional hold-backs or other clauses that might not work for you and your company.\r\n\r\nSign the final paperwork and complete your sale\r\n\r\nCongratulations! You’ve just sold your first company.\r\n\r\nWant more?\r\n\r\nElizabeth and Andrew dove deep into the whole process behind getting acquired. Setting yourself up for success early on, finding potential buyers, positioning your company, negotiating the deal, and more.\r\n\r\nHighly recommend watching it here (https://d2Mzlx04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/2O+113/d2Mzlx04/MXd-Xk3XyD_W4dfymn1bsRbRW8LzBkh5cv0htN5bb0jg3pyd0W7Y8-PT6lZ3pgVJg2qd7J3HyCW67Lstr54Y_13W39W8C72x3TKkW7xnYcd2vvxPgW8-pF5h94C4yhW7YwMrc4WRb8cW8N9kzP24LKYjW44vHwk3X1s9tW6TSpg84SYRpZVMygHk7ZjbdjW3lLW751rFs6_W6pW9ln5Y4Z3_W73r3bW1ZWG9vVTM1SH2Rc1QhW6j0p483zn1jwW4rhF1Z442hZWW2Z536y1hGJT5W6ht1xZ7Gj_MfW7XD5fC39RR4xW6T7FpB1kFFKQVJdylP5HzND7W4h8VMD2QD6Z4W3p3HW17L6KQCW1n_RM67yW0zpW1_nDZK3TMvgHW8frxq87vFDTHf8YkMvR04 ) .\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nCarolyn\r\n\r\nThis article was written by Carolyn Abram, a freelance writer with a passion for technology.

The greatest problem for a startup is not lack of money, nor fierce opposition.\r\nThe real problem is obscurity – people not knowing that you exist.\r\nIn my last essay Vivid Storytelling – How Great Founders Turn Bystanders into Believers [ https://substack.com/redirect/bda57b45-d775-4beb-beda-327b74040c06?j=eyJ1IjoiMThvNDE4In0.NISaA8T6ox_siOrBkiztHE1EMvrX0M2w6DvyJjK2MQc ], I wrote about how you can leverage the power of stories and visual words to get your message across.\r\nHowever, if you can’t hook people’s attention to begin with, you never get the chance to tell your story.\r\nSo how do you hook people’s attention?

Eventually, a pattern began to emerge. The ones that succeeded at hooking people’s attention shared the 3 FaMEx traits – while the ones that failed didn’t.\r\nLet’s dive into what each of these 3 traits means, and why they matter.\r\n1. Familiar – Make a subject relatable and relevant\r\nFamiliarity ensures people can relate to the subject, and that it plays a relevant role in their lives.\r\nWhen a subject is not familiar, people either:\r\nLose interest – as they can’t relate to the subject nor see how it’s relevant to them\r\nFeel confused – as they can’t connect the subject to any existing knowledge\r\nFamiliarity has one more benefit: we like things the more familiar they are to us. There are two psychological effects behind this:\r\nThe Endowment Effect: We get more attached to things we create, nurture, and have in our possession.\r\nThe Mere Exposure Effect: We grow to like things the more frequently we are exposed to them. When the Eiffel Tower was first built, many artists left the town in protest against the “gigantic black factory chimney”, “this odious column of bolted metal.” Today, the French celebrate the Eiffel Tower as the very symbol of Paris itself. \r\nThe more familiar a subject is to us, the more we view it as part of ourselves. And subjects that relate to ourselves are the most interesting ones in the world.\r\nHowever, familiarity alone won’t grab attention. We also need mysterious.\r\n2. Mysterious – Evoke curiosity through the Q-A gap\r\n“Mysterious” is what sparks people's curiosity in a subject.\r\nA mystery is when your mind is occupied with a question, but you don’t yet know the answer. It’s in this gap – between question and answer – that curiosity rushes in to fill the void.\r\nThe question-answer gap is what keeps your attention glued to the pages of a great novel. A good storyteller builds up several mysteries that make you ask “What will happen next?” – drawing you into the magnetic vortex of the story until your questions are finally answered.\r\nHowever, people will only get curious about subjects they can relate to. Your question must be an extension of a subject your audience is familiar with.\r\nFamiliar and mysterious are like the two teams of a football match. They set up the game. But to intensify people’s interest in the game, we need the 3rd trait: extreme.\r\n3. Extreme – Intensify interest by raising the stakes\r\n“Extreme” multiplies the appeal of the question-answer gap by raising the stakes.\r\nOne example is rock climber Alex Honnold, who in 2017 climbed a 900-meter vertical cliff with his bare hands and no ropes. His documentary, Free Solo [ https://substack.com/redirect/fbad5662-b2ef-439a-a69d-b050f9ca3c96?j=eyJ1IjoiMThvNDE4In0.NISaA8T6ox_siOrBkiztHE1EMvrX0M2w6DvyJjK2MQc ], will make you sit on the edge of your seat as you watch him hang over the gaping abyss – a single misstep meaning certain death.\r\nIf you are extreme enough, that alone can create a question-answer gap. Extreme things make people go “Wait… WHAT?!” – and get curious to find an answer to the extreme outlier.\r\nRichard Branson is a superb example of this. When he launched Virgin Cola, he rolled a Sherman battle tank onto Times Square – crushing Coca-Cola cans along the way. \r\nAn extreme claim must also be specific. So specific that people can instantly check and say if it’s true or not.\r\nWhen you use vague words like “many”, “quickly”, “easy”, or “low price” – you lose the extremeness and the credibility of your claim.\r\nTo make a claim that’s extreme and credible, specify your description with a HOW:\r\nAs the advertiser Claude Hopkins said:\r\n“If a claim is worth making, make it in the most specific way.”\r\nExamples – How to combine Familiar + Mysterious + Extreme\r\nBelow are 5 examples that have combined the 3 FaMEx traits successfully:\r\n1. “Read This or Die”\r\nOne example that brilliantly combines all three of the FaMEx traits is an ad for the Journal of Alternatives, which starts with the headline: “Read This or Die”. The body copy then follows with a bold but data-backed statement:\r\n“Today you have a 95 percent chance of eventually dying from a disease or condition for which there is already a known cure somewhere on the planet. The editor of Alternatives would like to free you from that destiny.” \r\nLet’s break down this ad with the FaMEx formula:\r\nFamiliar: ✅ “Death” is a familiar subject to any person, and it’s certainly high up on the priority list of things we wish to avoid. This makes the subject relevant to the reader.\r\nMysterious: ✅ Both the headline and body copy get the reader to ask questions: “What info could possibly be so important I might die if I don’t know it?” Most readers will be curious to learn more.\r\nExtreme: ✅ The extremeness of the headline instantly grabs your attention. The life-and-death matter also amplifies the question-answer gap by raising the stakes.\r\nWhen using a headline like “Read This or Die”, one must be very careful to not over-exaggerate. The claim has to be credibly backed by data, and also be relevant to the subject in the body copy, which this ad did superbly.\r\n2. The 4-Hour Work Week\r\nAnother great FaMEx example is the name Tim Ferriss chose for his best-seller book The 4-Hour Work Week:\r\nFamiliar: ✅ Everyone is familiar with the concept of the work week. And working fewer hours is a very relevant subject for most.\r\nMysterious: ✅ The book’s title gets the reader to ask: “How can you possibly make a living working just 4 hours a week?”. This question-answer gap sparks one’s curiosity to learn more.\r\nExtreme: ✅ Most people work at least 40 hours a week, and many as much as 60-80 hours. The audacity that it’s possible to work just 4 hours a week multiplies the power of the question-answer gap.\r\nWhen naming his book, Tim Ferriss also tested many other potential titles, including The Wild Gooserace and This Sucks, How to Live Like a Druglord.  If we use the FaMEx formula, we can see why these titles failed:\r\nFamiliar: ❌ “Gooserace” is not a familiar subject to anyone. “Drug lords” is a bit better, but few people will actually want to live like one. Both subjects thus lack relevance.\r\nMysterious: ❌ The title The Wild Gooserace doesn’t get the reader to ask a question, so there is no mystery. The second title is better. But the most likely question this title will evoke is: “Why would I want to live like a drug lord?”.\r\nExtreme: ❌ / ✅  The first title commits a serious flaw: it lacks specificity. It uses the word “wild”, but without a HOW to specify how wild. The second title is more specific, offering a clear HOW in “live like a drug lord”. But again, this title ultimately fails due to lack of relevance.\r\n3. Quaker Oats – “125 million explosions in every cereal grain”\r\nBreakfast cereal may hardly seem like the most exciting topic. But only to those lazy enough not to do their research.\r\nDo enough research on any product, and you’ll find surprising facts that will amaze anyone who hears about them.\r\nThis is what advertiser Claude Hopkins did to come up with a hook point for Quaker Oats’ Puffed Grain cereal – leading to the headline “Food Shot From Guns”, followed by the statement “125 million explosions in each grain”. \r\nFamiliar: ✅ Everyone is familiar with breakfast and cereal.\r\nMysterious: ✅ The ad gets the reader to ask questions: “How can food be shot from guns?”, and “How can 125 million explosions possibly occur in a tiny grain of rice?”\r\nExtreme: ✅ Both the headline and the 125 million explosion statement are specific and extreme.\r\n4. Paranormal Activity – the power of suggestion\r\nCan you create an extreme effect without actually making a claim – and on a shoestring budget?\r\nYes, by using the power of suggestion.\r\nSuggestion means you only show glimpses and indirect effects of the real thing. As a result, people will imagine the real thing to be much more extreme than it actually is.\r\nThe horror movie Paranormal Activity is a great example of this. When launching the trailer for the movie, they barely showed any scenes from the movie. In fact, the movie’s slow build-up would have made the scenes boring if shown in a short-form trailer.\r\nInstead, the trailer showed people’s fearful reactions as they were watching the movie.\r\nRather than showing how scary the scenes were – they suggested that the scenes were incredibly scary by showing people’s reactions to them. \r\nFamiliar: ✅ We all have experienced fear. And for those who enjoy horror movies, this experience is very relevant.\r\nMysterious: ✅ Watching people’s fearful reactions, you can’t help but wonder: “What could possibly be so scary to make people react like that?”\r\nExtreme: ✅ The scenes themselves weren’t extreme. But by using suggestion, those who watched the trailer would imagine scenes much more horrific than the actual footage.\r\nAnother great example of suggestion is the movie Jaws, where the shark never makes any physical appearance in the first scenes. The audience only sees the indirect effects of the shark, making them imagine it as much more fearful. \r\n5. “Buy stolen merchandise”\r\nThe budget company Consumers Hero created a stellar ad with the headline: “Buy stolen merchandise if you’re willing to take a risk”. The headline was followed by this body copy:\r\n“We developed an exciting new consumer marketing concept. It’s called “stealing.” That’s right, stealing!\r\nNow if that sounds bad, look at the facts. Consumers are being robbed. Inflation is stealing our purchasing power. Our dollars are shrinking in value. The poor average consumer is plundered, robbed and stepped on.\r\n[Our concept is to] recycle “lousy rotten” garbage into super new products with five-year warranties.\r\nWe steal from the rich manufacturers and give to the poor consumer.” \r\nLet’s break this ad down with the FaMEx formula:\r\nFamiliar: ✅ The concept of stealing is simple to understand, and the promise of saving money is always relevant.\r\nMysterious: ✅ The headline gets the reader to ask: “How can they possibly advertise stolen merchandise?”. We want to keep reading to find the answer.\r\nExtreme: ✅ Advertising “stolen” merchandise is certainly an extreme statement, which only makes the itch to keep reading that much stronger.\r\nSummary\r\nThe greatest problem for a startup is not opposition, but obscurity. If people don’t know you exist, nothing you do matters.\r\nBut to fight obscurity, you must first hook people’s attention.\r\nTo make an effective hook, use the 3 traits of the FaMEx formula as a checklist:\r\nIs my hook Familiar?: Relate your subject to something your audience is familiar with – and that plays a relevant role in their lives.\r\nIs my hook Mysterious?: Get your audience to ask a question about your familiar subject.\r\nIs my hook Extreme?: Make your statement dramatic, and make it specific. Specify it with a HOW – HOW fast, simple, powerful – until people can say instantly if the statement is true or not.\r\nWhile these 3 traits are present in any great hook, there are many different ways you can combine them. Some of these approaches include:\r\nPick a common subject, and flip it to an extreme: This is the approach of “Read This or Die”, “The 4-Hour Work Week”, and “Buy Stolen Merchandise”. They use subjects as common as water is to a fish – we hardly notice these subjects until they are pointed out. This makes the extreme flip that much more dramatic.\r\nMine your subject for surprising facts: This is the approach Claude Hopkins took to discover the “125 million explosions in every grain” fact about Quaker Oats cereal. Focus especially on how the product is produced, and what outcomes it can achieve.\r\nUse the power of suggestion: Show only glimpses and indirect effects. Suggestion takes less effort from you, and your audience will dramatize your subject even more in their imagination.\r\nThis is by no means an exhaustive list. But I hope it can spark your creative flame.\r\nWhat hook point is right for your particular case… I can’t say. As these examples show, every situation has its own unique hook. I can only leave you with this final piece of advice:\r\nMake it familiar.\r\nMake it mysterious.\r\nMake it extreme.\r\nHappy hook-pointing!\r\nIn my next essay, I will cover how to sustain attention once you got it\r\nThanks for reading,\r\nHenrik Angelstig\r\nSubscribe for free to get more essays like this.\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe https://substack.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.VJZU8eA8zlrRoNvYeh879yB84XN55ykFkRD-hcXAjg0?"

I should know - I tried to start one [ https://substack.com/redirect/5d350775-de35-4bbb-856a-6a4d0c03f91b?j=eyJ1IjoiMThvNDE4In0.NISaA8T6ox_siOrBkiztHE1EMvrX0M2w6DvyJjK2MQc ].\r\nAt the heart of any (highly functioning) marketplace you’ll feel the pull of network effects. The more users there are on the product, the more valuable the product becomes. For example, AirBnB’s value depends on the number of properties guests can rent. And it will become a better product (and business model) over time because more people will add more supply. The converse is it’s not valuable at all when there are no good places to stay.\r\nNetwork effects are a prized competitive moat - there’s an obvious defensibility as you get bigger. You can’t just fast-follow a marketplace business once it picks up steam. While marketplaces are difficult to start, once they get to rippppin’, they actually get cheaper to grow.\r\nAuthor’s note: It’s important to point out that marketplaces are a flavor of network effects, not the other way around (social media and collaboration tools are also driven by network effects).\r\nDan Hockenmaier (Thumbtack, Faire) points out this CAC to LTV inversion that takes place. Unlike software, where it gets incrementally harder to acquire new customers and grow them, with a marketplace you are actually acquiring the marginal good fit customer over time. It gets better as it gets bigger.\r\nI studied the business models of 35 marketplaces. \r\nHere’s what you can learn from this analysis:\r\nI. The Economics: How take rates are determined + figuring out who pays\r\nII. Key Insights from Research: Mistakes and unlocks from real companies\r\nIII. Ways to Increase Take Rate Overtime: Adding services and differentiating\r\nI. The Economics\r\nMarketplaces monetize through a take rate. If you’re talking the lingo, other common names for this type of middleman compensation include:\r\nCommission\r\nVig\r\nRake\r\nThis post was originally inspired by a piece that Lenny Rachitsky [ https://substack.com/redirect/e29f8b9a-5119-42e1-91c4-51da2ab02cf1?j=eyJ1IjoiMThvNDE4In0.NISaA8T6ox_siOrBkiztHE1EMvrX0M2w6DvyJjK2MQc ] wrote on choosing a take rate. As a finance and business model nerd, I wanted to expand the data set and go one step further to arrive at an estimated total effective take rate that marketplace businesses achieve.\r\nWhy? Well, it’s very common for one side of a marketplace transaction to not even realize that the other side is also being charged, allowing the business to double up or subsidize one side to make it more attractive and increase throughput volume.\r\nHere’s what I found:\r\nII.

Please note that if you choose one of them as the only student, we will still ask you to fund their travel expenses.\r\n\r\nProduct Management Intern:\r\nAlejandra Sarmiento\r\nAvah Harris\r\nKevin Zamudio\r\n\r\nData Science Intern:\r\nAlan Hernandez\r\nAlejandra Sarmiento\r\nAvery Metzcar\r\nDavid Agyei\r\nGabe True\r\nHady Aly\r\nKalysa Blunt\r\nKevin Zamudio\r\nRocio Jerez\r\nTomas Quinteros\r\n\r\nEntrepreneur in Residence\r\nDavid Agyei\r\nWael Kouki\r\nMaria Rojas\r\nAlejandra Sarmiento\r\nGabe True\r\n\r\nThank you so much and please let me know if you have any questions!\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nChiara\r\n\r\nChiara Montanari, PhD\r\nSenior Associate Director, International Careers\r\nCareer Advancement | University of Chicago Center in Paris\r\nchiaram@uchicago.edu<mailto:chiaram@uchicago.edu>\r\nhttps://careeradvancement.uchicago.edu/\r\n\r\n"

Buyers must compare a variety of models, orchestration frameworks and deployment services to balance cost and performance.<br> <br> In addressing this opportunity, companies in our large language model operations market map have nearly closed more VC deals in the last 14 months than in the prior three years combined. To track how these new products fit together, PitchBook senior analyst Brendan Burke will discuss the structure and state of the large language model app stack with AI developer community leader Yujian Tang, a senior developer advocate at Zilliz. Key topics include: \r\n        <ul> \r\n         <li>How software engineers select orchestration tools to build for the two biggest use cases: retrieval-augmented generation and AI agents.</li> \r\n         <br> \r\n         <li>Data preparation techniques to bring unstructured, multimodal data to large language model applications.</li> \r\n         <br> \r\n         <li>Deployment tradeoffs with new, small models and hardware constraints.</li> \r\n        </ul> <a href=\"https://url6380.news.pitchbook.com/ls/click?upn=u001.d4n73BrX4Cuylw7SpSWIrf6GFa-2BaqM7ONnvsnswouzV9i6HS-2FjjUxVNU-2BbF4muOjQFS8gSVrujSJVKefu0XENg-3D-3D2e63_mXWbCJTdrES8Bxix4B8DWsuZWsf2pJD1fUw-2FR9E86ywNTBaboietb4wB1t0OL3RYBDmbd3Co30nIfElpLrvOb3lDAQ-2F0U-2FL0BEUQGoSVuzwB6YsDQK5rtk0fAjQj28E8DNB-2BhNX7QacgauegtDhZO2Dub9UIcw6Xuxu-2FGTo6wr6XQX0J5Bcrfh8-2BE-2Bd5QaSbSO-2FiYZ5NtWWRXt1Ayop5TGX7E0iNyRtHWRR4NRRyl5MIfM2bTTc-2BLyIfPvyrOba1Ix5Irw6hECwNs9umTBDnAPKYP-2BqQPrndL4AE-2FGHD5hpPmPODq4RrIr4E6HrZWtW9BCHfTnry81kcnhvArVZxWhiq74egVKqKX6Iy31TrXyktlTPw-2FOYKzBBe2xYk-2BHDO\" style=\"color: #1D5080;
